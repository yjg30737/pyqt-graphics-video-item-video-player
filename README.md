* The cursor stays on the control widget
* The cursor moves again

Control widget is going to hide when
* The cursor leaves from the window
* The cursor stays outside of the control widget

#### 2. Preview of watching video with the pyqt-graphics-video-item-video-player and using control widget to navigate the video (Example video is result video of <a href="https://github.com/yjg30737/pyqt-find-replace-text-widget.git">pyqt-find-replace-text-widget</a>.)

## Note
QGraphicsVideoItem's video quality is worse than QVideoWidgets.

You maybe wonder why did i make this in the first place.

Because for some reasons, I can't show the control widget (which has transparent background) over the QVideoWidget.

I'm still trying to figure out the way to solve this problem.

One more thing, There are some flaws in timer feature and button toggling. I will fix it.
